# DiRT Rally Cross-Platform Results


## About
This tool downloads DiRT Rally online event results for all platforms (Steam, PS4, Xbox, Oculus) and saves them in one file. It is originally created by [/u/Th3HolyMoose](https://reddit.com/u/Th3HolyMoose).

## Usage
Using this tool is very easy - just run one command and it will generate all result files.
To run this tool, simply type `python daily.py` for last daily events or `python weekly.py` for weekly events.

My additions at this point allows choosing specific platforms and toggleable html page generator.
* To specify platforms, use `python daily.py steam,psn,live,oculus`. Same for `weekly.py`.
* If You don't want to generate HTML page, add `nohtml` parameter. This will give only text file with downloaded data.
